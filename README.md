The most popular start and end station for riders is at Grove St. PATH. Perhaps because this location is at the intersection of Grove Street, Newark Avenue and Railroad Avenue in the Downtown neighborhood of Jersey City, New Jersey. It is served by the Newark–World Trade Center line at all times, the Journal Square–33rd Street line on weekdays (except for during the late-evening and early-morning hours), and the Journal Square–33rd Street (via Hoboken) line on weekends and during late-evening and early-morning weekday hours. The intersection is also a busy stop for buses, most of which head west and south.

Ridership growth increased between the months of May and October. During the summer months, tourists add to the local commuters. More people are also out and about when the weather is nicer.

The total number of trips for 2018 was 17.5 million. The total number of users during this time period was 353,892. This is comprised of 331,725 subscribers and 22,167 customers. The users are predominantly male, 72.66% vs. 21.29% female. There is a small 6.05% of unknowns in the gender distribution. Whether it be a weekday or a weekend, there are more male riders using Citi Bike.

There is a constant growth in annual memberships from January to December of 2018. In January there were 7.8 million annual members. By the end of the year, this grew to 9.2 million. As shown in the graph, the peak of short-term customers are from May to October. As mentioned earlier, there is an increase of tourists during the summer/fall months. The weather is also nicer for locals to commute by bike.

The peak hours for both the summer and winter months are at 8am and 6pm. A large number of the riders for these hours are most likely individuals who are going to and from work. 

On average, riders who are 20 years old have the longest trip duration. However, there are more older individuals (specifically 51 year olds), who ride more but with shorter trip duration.

It is also good to note that some of the birth year in the dataset are incorrect and unrealistic. The graph shows that there are 5,631 90 year olds, 482 120 year olds, and 14,697 130 year olds that rode during the time period. The birth year indicated in the dataset for the last two are 1900 and 1881.
